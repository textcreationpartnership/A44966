            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>GENTELMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I am not ignorant that whatever comes forth in Print, altho it aſſert Allegiance to the King, and Obedience to Magiſtrates, yet now a days it is <hi>Alamode</hi> to Libel it: as I fancy not the ſheltring my ſelf under any mans Wings in a matter of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe it ſignifies in my apprehenſion a diſtruſt of what is written; which were I Guilty of, I would not come in publick View. So alſo I decline to Court the Readers with a flattering Epiſtle for their approbation, it being irrational, yea redicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, to think that judicious men will be wrought upon by any thing but what convinces their Judgments and Reaſons, and not according to mens Fancies and Affections, and he that judges o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, is not a competent Judg, neither ſhall I vallue what ſuch men ſay. Gentelmen, if you ſeriouſly conſider what ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Cirtumſtances have of late attended the managemet of State-Affairs in this our Hemiſphear; it muſt needs be matter of wonder and aſtoniſhment; and I will appeal to all ſober per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are not byaſſed by Intereſt, or ſwayed by Paſſion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they believe any Hiſtory can parallel the impudent Libels and ſaucy Pamphlets that have lately been expoſed to publick View, <hi>Tempora mutantur a principio non fuit ita,</hi> the excellent ſaying of the reno wired Lord Chief-Juſtice <hi>North,</hi> is truely ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56192:2"/>That his Majeſty is merciful even to a Miracle, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the violent Commotions in State-Affairs, how great hath been the Prudence of our Royal Soveraign, who in Concurrence with his honourable Privy-Council in the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of the Parliament hath continued us in Peace. How great have been the Clamors of Popery and Arbitrary Government; yet whoſe Rights and Priviledges have been in the leaſt meaſure invaded. Gentlemen, I earneſtly implore of you, that you will let Reaſon have its Domination and Rule in you, and ſuffer not your ſelves to be miſled, nor inſinuated by men who pretend Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to the King, and proſperity to the Government, when in reality, Ambition is their only Aim; for no man who is <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis</hi> can believe that thoſe men who in their Caballs ſtrive to carry on private Deſigns contrary to the know'n will of their Soveraign, can wiſh real happineſs to his perſon or good to his Government, but only to become popular. Therefore I do poſitively aver it is the undoubted Right of our Soveraign to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit whom he pleaſeth to be of his Privy-Council and at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for Reaſons beſt know'n to himſelf, to ſend them a <hi>Quietus eſt,</hi> and by this he fully underſtands their Tempers and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in whoſe Judgments he may faithfully rely; and it is a Duty incumbent upon all, from the higheſt to the loweſt, ſtill to return their Fidelity and Allegiance to the King, and not to murmur nor ſlighly to inſinuate into the people, a miſconſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their Princes Actions and a miſlike of his Government; it was a true ſaying by a Peer who received eminent and ſignal Favours from his Prince, that they that, fall under the diſpleaſure of their Prince fall gentely; God grant it may work a thorow Reformation. It is common among all men to cry long live the King, let not their Actions give their Tongues the Lie. Let them ſpeedily put in practiſe thoſe things that tend to adminiſter peace to their Soveraigns Mind and tranquility to his Life; and now Gentelmen and fellow-Citizens, I will addreſs my ſelf more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly unto you: I very well know you are not ignorant of an Addreſs lately preſented to my Lord Mayor, wherein the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are earneſt with my Lord to repreſent them Loyal to the King, and that they are ready to joyn in the defence of his Royal perſon and the Proteſtant Religion againſt all Attempts and Plots. There are many hundreds of the Commons likewiſe, who were not preſent at the delivery of that Addreſs, who deſire that thoſe Gentelmen that were, will be pleaſed in a ſecond Addreſs to my Lord Mayor, deſire him to acquaint his Majeſty of their readineſs to joyn with thoſe Gentlemen that were not there, in the defence of his Majeſties Royal perſon, and the Proteſtant
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56192:2"/>Religion eſtabliſhed by Law, without any Alteration either in Church or State; and that the Parliament may Convene when his Majeſty ſhall judg it moſt convenient for his own benefit and the Nations welfare; and that then all Animoſities and Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Parties by Names may be obliterated, and that we may all ſtrive to exceed each other in our fearing God and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the King; then may we expect Peace and plenty to coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit amongſt us, which that it may <hi>faxit v<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ni.</hi> I ſhall take the freedome to reaſſume the Addreſs, it were well if thoſe worthy Citizens who delivered the Addreſs, would acquaint their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Citizens particularly with the Names of the perſons who miſrepreſented us to the King, that innocent perſons might not be in the Catalogue of indiſcreet informers: I could heartily wiſh (my dear fellow-Citizens) that thoſe perſons whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations have in them a propenſity to Paſſion and Ambition would permit of Reaſon to bear ſway; and that they would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider of the ſpeech lately ſpoken by our preſent Loyal Lord Mayor; who therein declares, that he calls God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he never did miſrepreſent the Citizens to his Majeſty, nor he does not eaſily believe any would. Were there but a candid Conſtruction put on mens Actions, and that men could not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit every idle and impertinent Story, there would then be no room left for Jealouſies and Animoſities amongſt us. O I do poſitively aver, never any Magiſtrate ſerved his Majeſty more faithfully, nor the City more honeſty than our preſent Magiſtrate conſidering the preſent circumſtances that we lie under, and it is very plain he is not eaſily inſinuated and wheedled by the little Artifices of hot headed and turbulent men. It is well known he has a plentiful Eſtate, and therefore he does not covet Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but makes it his greateſt Care to ſerve his King and Country, and that which many men ſtrive to attain, <hi>per fui &amp; nefas,</hi> he is inveſted with power in himſelf, to wit, to be a Member of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. It is to be hoped that our noble Senators at their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, being very ſenſible of the Deſigns and Caballs of Men of Republican Spirits in this long Enterval, will fruſtrate them, and will by a unanimous concurrence amongſt themſelves follow the Examples of their Anceſtors, and ſupply his Majeſty frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and by this means they will endear his Majeſty to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and his Subjects to him: whoever they are that are of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinion, their diſcent is not from the Reſult of a delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Judgment, or a well regulated Reaſon, but upon the ſcore of ſelf-Intereſt; or elſe they are ſuch who thorow inadvertencie or ſecular advantage, have been formerly concerned in Lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing either to Church or State; and it is evident what the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56192:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Deſigns of ſuch Men are, and what they aim at: witneſs ſome Wills which have been lately made, wherein after they had bequeathed great part of their Eſtates, they are pleaſed to inſert in order to the Lands formerly in their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. If Providence ſhall order a return they bequeath it for ſuch and ſuch Uſes. It is very obvious to conſidering men, they have a mind to be fiſhing with the old Ba<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t; but from Men of ſuch Principles, <hi>Libra nos Domine,</hi> and I think his very perſpicnous to all ſober good men, that ſome Citizens amongſt us, who were very Zealous for the Convention of the Parliament, their Zeal was not out of publick good either to the King or people; but for advantage to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and to be accounted great in the eſteem of the Vulgar; and yet theſe are the Men who are very fierce againſt worſhiping of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Calves, either at <hi>Dan</hi> or <hi>Bethel,</hi> yet account it nor Icolatry to be Idolized themſelves. For had they not been half witted, they muſt needs have remembred what his Majeſty had formerly declared, that it was his Reſolution to continue the Parliament by ſhort Prorogations, not reſolving their Sitting til <hi>November,</hi> unleſs Affairs from abroad occaſioned him to appoint their ſooner Convention. I do believe there is no rational Man but is of Opinion it is the Subjects Right to Petition their Prince, but to Petition for that which his Majeſty had reſolved ſhould be, looks as if they doubted of his Majeſties performance; and none but men of ſhallow principles would entertain ſuch Notions. It is very well known there are ſome perſons amongſt us of Antimonarchial Principles, who are for mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, which is the Licentiouſneſs of the Preſs, which hath greatly occaſioned our Domeſtick jars: I could heartily wiſh, that many of thoſe Gentlemen who diſcent from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> not in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals but in Circumſtantials, would not allow nor manifeſt their approbation to many of thoſe pernicious and lying Pamphlets which reflect on his Majeſty and his Government, would they but openly in Print declare their diſlike and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of them, it would greatly demonſtrate <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

It is to be hoped our Senators will take Cognizance of many things worthy of their ſpeedy and ſerious Conſideration in this long Interval, and will be happy Inſtruments of ſetling this our diſtracted Nation, in Peace and quietneſs, what an happy Sight will it be to ſee the King and his People Accord, a threefold Cord is not eaſily broken.
